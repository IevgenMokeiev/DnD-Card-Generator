  abilities:
    Amphibious: The aboleth can breathe air and water.<br/>
    Mucous Cloud: While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus.
      A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while
      within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
      the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only
      underwater.<br/>
    Probing Telepathy: If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth,
      the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the
      creature.<br/>
  actions:
    Multiattack: The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.<br/>
    Tentacle: +9, 10 ft., 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature,
      it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The
      disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures
      disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and
      slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the
      disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level
      or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid
      damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes
      have passed.<br/>
    Tail: +9, 10 ft., 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.<br/>
    Enslave (3/Day): The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of
      it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed
      by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of
      existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control
      and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically
      with each other over any distance.<br/>Whenever the charmed target takes damage,
      the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more
      than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it
      is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.<br/>
  legendary:
  - The aberration can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.
    Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another
    creature's turn. The aberration regains spent legendary actions at the start of
    its turn.<br/>
  - Detect: The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br/>
  - Tail Swipe: The aboleth makes one tail attack.<br/>
  - Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions): One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10
      (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage
      the creature takes.<br/>

      is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage
      against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target
      is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached,
      the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on
      the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.
      A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker
      by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.<br/>
    Tail: +6, 10 ft., one creature. 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.<br/>
    Moan: Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that
      isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
      until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful,
      the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.<br/>
    Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): The cloaker magically creates
      three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates
      move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible
      to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of
      bright light, the duplicates disappear.<br/>Whenever any creature targets the
      cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature
      rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates.
      A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies
      on senses other than sight.<br/>A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its
      saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving
      throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.<br/>

      no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The

      and it moves with the target.<br/>A creature can detach the darkmantle by making
      a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle
      can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.<br/>
    Darkness Aura (1/Day): A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the
      darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as
      long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating
      on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light
      can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created
      by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.<br/>

    Fey Charm: The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30
      feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom
      saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad
      as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under
      the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable
      way it can.<br/>Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the
      target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
      Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different
      plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If
      a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey
      Charm for the next 24 hours.<br/>The dryad can have no more than one humanoid
      and up to three beasts charmed at a time.<br/>

  abilities:
    Ooze Cube: The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space,
      but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage
      on the saving throw.<br/>Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total
      cover.<br/>A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
      creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength
      check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.<br/>The
      cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures
      inside it at a time.<br/>
    Transparent: Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15
      Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked.
      A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is
      surprised by the cube.<br/>
  actions:
    Pseudopod: +4, 5 ft., one creature. 10 (3d6) acid damage.<br/>
    Engulf: The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or
      smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the
      creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.<br/>On a successful save,
      the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube.
      A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed
      saving throw.<br/>On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and
      the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature
      can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of
      each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with
      it.<br/>An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a
      DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space
      of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.<br/>

    Incorporeal Movement: The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as
      if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its
      turn inside an object.<br/>
  actions:
    Withering Touch: +5, 5 ft., 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.<br/>
    Etherealness: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or
      vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal,
      and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other
      plane.<br/>
    Horrifying Visage: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can
      see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
      If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened
      target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
      frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful
      or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage
      for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a  greater restoration
      spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.<br/>
    Possession (Recharge 6): One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of
      it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost;
      the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control
      of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target
      of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,
      except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
      Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the
      possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,
      class features, or proficiencies.<br/>The possession lasts until the body drops
      to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned
      or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession
      ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
      The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding
      on the saving throw or after the possession ends.<br/>

    Mimicry: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that
      hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom
      (Insight) check.<br/>
    Innate Spellcasting: 'The hag''s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell
      save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
      components:<br/>At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery<br/>'
  actions:
    Claws: +6, 5 ft., 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br/>
    Illusory Appearance: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
      with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general
      size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
      end it or if she dies.<br/>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up
      to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin,
      but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must
      take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence
      (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.<br/>
    Invisible Passage: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts
      a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While
      invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked
      only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.<br/>

    Wall of Ice (Recharge 6): The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a

      up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet
      in diameter.<br/>When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed
      out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall
      to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes
      a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save,
      or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>The wall lasts for 1 minute

      each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage,
      and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section
      is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
      Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly
      or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking
      17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.<br/>

  abilities:
    Amphibious: The kraken can breathe air and water.<br/>
    Freedom of Movement: The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects
      can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of
      movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.<br/>
    Siege Monster: The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.<br/>
  actions:
    Multiattack: The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace
      with one use of Fling.<br/>
    Bite: +17, 5 ft., 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller
      creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple
      ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total
      cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42
      (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken
      takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken
      must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
      regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet
      of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained
      by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.<br/>
    Tentacle: +17, 30 ft., 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled
      (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken
      has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple<br/>
    Fling: One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is
      thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target
      strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every
      10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature
      must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be
      knocked prone.<br/>
    Lightning Storm: The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of
      which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target
      must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>
  legendary:
  - The monstrosity (titan) can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
    below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of
    another creature's turn. The monstrosity (titan) regains spent legendary actions
    at the start of its turn.<br/>
  - Tentacle Attack or Fling: The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.<br/>
  - Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions): The kraken uses Lightning Storm.<br/>
  - Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions): While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud
      in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily
      obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken
      that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw,
      taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears
      at the end of the kraken's next turn.<br/>

    Petrifying Gaze: When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn
      within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution
      saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If

      a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The
      restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,
      becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification
      lasts until the creature is freed by the  greater restoration spell or other
      magic.<br/>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
      throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa
      until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature
      looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.<br/>If

    Night Hag Items: 'A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must
      craft for herself. If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great
      lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.<br/>Heartstone:
      This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in
      her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a
      heartstone takes 30 days.<br/>Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result
      of a night hag''s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black
      sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time,
      and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting
      a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make
      the bag).<br/>'
    Innate Spellcasting: 'The hag''s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell
      save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following
      spells, requiring no material components:<br/>At will: detect magic, magic missile<br/>2/day

  actions:
    Claws (Hag Form Only): +7, 5 ft., 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br/>
    Change Shape: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid,
      or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment
      she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if
      she dies.<br/>
    Etherealness: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane,
      or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.<br/>
    Nightmare Haunting (1/Day): While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches
      a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell
      cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as
      the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last
      for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit
      point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit
      point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
      trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum
      lasts until removed by the  greater restoration spell or similar magic.<br/>

  abilities:
    Amphibious: The hag can breathe air and water.<br/>
    Horrific Appearance: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag
      and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a
      failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
      the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag
      is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
      saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune
      to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.<br/>Unless the target
      is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target
      can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start
      of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack
      rolls against the hag.<br/>
  actions:
    Claws: +5, 5 ft., 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.<br/>
    Death Glare: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet
      of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving
      throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.<br/>
    Illusory Appearance: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
      with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general
      size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
      end it or if she dies.<br/>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up
      to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,
      but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must
      take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence
      (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.<br/>

  abilities:
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose
      to succeed instead.<br/>
    Magic Resistance: The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells
      and other magical effects.<br/>
    Reflective Carapace: Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell,
      a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a
      1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and
      the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the
      tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.<br/>
    Siege Monster: The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.<br/>
  actions:
    Multiattack: 'The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five
      attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one
      with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.<br/>'
    Bite: +19, 10 ft., 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature,
      it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
      and the tarrasque can't bite another target.<br/>
    Claw: +19, 15 ft., 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.<br/>
    Horns: +19, 10 ft., 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage.<br/>
    Tail: +19, 20 ft., 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature,
      it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.<br/>
    Frightful Presence: Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of
      it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
      for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the
      effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or
      the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful
      Presence for the next 24 hours.<br/>
    Swallow: The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature
      it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the
      target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is
      blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
      outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
      of the tarrasque's turns.<br/>If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a
      single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20
      Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
      creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the
      tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape
      from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.<br/>
  legendary:
  - The monstrosity (titan) can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
    below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of
    another creature's turn. The monstrosity (titan) regains spent legendary actions
    at the start of its turn.<br/>
  - Attack: The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack.<br/>
  - Move: The tarrasque moves up to half its speed.<br/>
  - Chomp (Costs 2 Actions): The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.<br/>

  abilities:
    Shapechanger: If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its
      action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into
      its true form.<br/>While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed
      is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than
      its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it,
      but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br/>While
      in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects.
      It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a
      hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through
      a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.
      It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and
      it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.<br/>
    Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose
      to succeed instead.<br/>
    Misty Escape: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire
      transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling
      unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't
      transform, it is destroyed.<br/>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't
      revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours
      or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form.
      It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1
      hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.<br/>
    Regeneration: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it
      has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire
      takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function
      at the start of the vampire's next turn.<br/>
    Spider Climb: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down
      on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br/>
    Vampire Weaknesses: The vampire has the following flaws:<br/>Forbiddance. The
      vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br/>Harmed
      by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running
      water.<br/>Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into
      the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place,
      the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br/>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.
      The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While
      in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br/>
  actions:
    Multiattack (Vampire Form Only): The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which
      can be a bite attack.<br/>
    Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only): +9, 5 ft., one creature. 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning
      damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape
      DC 18).<br/>
    Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only): +9, 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature
      that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing
      damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced
      by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit
      points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a
      long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
      A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following
      night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.<br/>
    Charm: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the
      target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
      throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards
      the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target
      isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions
      in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's
      bite attack.<br/>Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything
      harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
      itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire
      is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes
      a bonus action to end the effect.<br/>
    Children of the Night (1/Day): The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of swarm
      of bats or swarm of rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the
      vampire can call 3d6 wolf instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds,
      acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts
      remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them
      as a bonus action.<br/>
